3710,577,Country,Merle Haggard,Mama Tri,The first thing I remember knowing
3711,578,Country,Merle Haggard,Mama Tri,Was a lonesome whistle blowing
3712,579,Country,Merle Haggard,Mama Tri,And a young'un's dream of growing up to ride
3713,580,Country,Merle Haggard,Mama Tri,On a freight train leaving town
3714,581,Country,Merle Haggard,Mama Tri,Not knowing where I'm bound
3715,582,Country,Merle Haggard,Mama Tri,And no one could change my mind but Mama tried

3724,593,Country,Merle Haggard,Mama Tri,"Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied"

3727,597,Country,Merle Haggard,Mama Tri,Left my mom a heavy load
3728,598,Country,Merle Haggard,Mama Tri,She tried so very hard to fill his shoes
3729,599,Country,Merle Haggard,Mama Tri,Working hours without rest
3730,600,Country,Merle Haggard,Mama Tri,Wanted me to have the best
3731,601,Country,Merle Haggard,Mama Tri,She tried to raise me right but I refused
3732,603,Country,Merle Haggard,Mama Tri,And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole

3853,751,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
3854,752,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,I fell in love with a Mexican girl
3855,753,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Night-time would find me in Rosa's cantina
3856,754,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Music would play and Felina would whirl
3857,756,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Blacker than night were the eyes of Felina
3858,757,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Wicked and evil while casting a spell
3859,758,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,My love was deep for this Mexican maiden
3860,759,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,"I was in love but in vain, I could tell"
3861,761,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,One night a wild young cowboy came in
3862,762,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Wild as the West Texas wind
3863,763,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Dashing and daring
3864,764,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,A drink he was sharing
3865,765,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,With wicked Felina
3866,766,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,The girl that I loved
3867,768,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,So in anger I
3868,769,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Challenged his right for the love of this maiden
3869,770,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
3870,771,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,My challenge was answered in less than a heart-beat
3871,772,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor
3872,774,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Just for a moment I stood there in silence
3873,775,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
3874,776,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
3875,777,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,I had but one chance and that was to run
3876,779,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran
3877,780,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Out where the horses were tied
3878,781,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,I caught a good one
3879,782,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,It looked like it could run
3880,783,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Up on its back
3881,784,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,And away I did ride
3882,786,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Just as fast as I
3883,787,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Could from the West Texas town of El Paso
3884,788,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Out to the bad-lands of New Mexico
3885,790,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
3886,791,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Everything's gone in lifenothing is left
3887,792,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
3888,793,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,My love is stronger than my fear of death
3889,795,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,I saddled up and away I did go
3890,796,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Riding alone in the dark
3891,797,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Maybe tomorrow
3892,798,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,A bullet may find me
3893,799,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Tonight nothing's worse than this
3894,800,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Pain in my heart
3895,802,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,And at last here I
3896,803,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Am on the hill overlooking El Paso
3897,804,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,I can see Rosa's cantina below
3898,805,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,My love is strong and it pushes me onward
3899,806,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Down off the hill to Felina I go
3900,808,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
3901,809,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Off to my left ride a dozen or more
3902,810,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Shouting and shooting I can't let them catch me
3903,811,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,I have to make it to Rosa's back door
3904,813,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Something is dreadfully wrong for I feel
3905,814,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,A deep burning pain in my side
3906,815,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Though I am trying
3907,816,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,To stay in the saddle
3908,817,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,I'm getting weary
3909,818,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Unable to ride
3910,820,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,But my love for
3911,821,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Felina is strong and I rise where I've fallen
3912,822,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Though I am weary I can't stop to rest
3913,823,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
3914,824,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,I feel the bullet go deep in my chest
3915,826,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,From out of nowhere Felina has found me
3916,827,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
3917,828,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
3918,829,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,"One little kiss and Felina, good-bye"

18059,4171,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,On a farm way back up in the woods
18060,4172,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,I was so ragged the folks used to call me Patches
18061,4173,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,Papa used to tease me about it 'Course deep down inside
18062,4174,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,He was hurt 'cause he'd done all he could
18063,4176,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,My papa was a great old man
18064,4177,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,I can see him with a shovel in his hand
18065,4178,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,"See, education he never had"
18066,4179,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,He did wonders when the times got bad
18067,4180,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,The little money from the crops he raised
18068,4181,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,Barely paid the bills we made

18070,4183,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,When he tried to get up life would kick him back down
18071,4184,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,One day papa called me to his dyin' bed
18072,4185,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,Put his hands on my shoulders And in tears he said
18073,4186,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,"He said ""Patches, I'm depending on you son,"

18083,4198,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on
18084,4199,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,I wanted to leave just run away from home
18085,4200,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,But I would remember what my daddy said
