751,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
752,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,I fell in love with a Mexican girl
753,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Night-time would find me in Rosa's cantina
754,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Music would play and Felina would whirl
756,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Blacker than night were the eyes of Felina
757,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Wicked and evil while casting a spell
758,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,My love was deep for this Mexican maiden
759,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,"I was in love but in vain, I could tell"
761,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,One night a wild young cowboy came in
762,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Wild as the West Texas wind
763,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Dashing and daring
764,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,A drink he was sharing
765,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,With wicked Felina
766,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,The girl that I loved
768,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,So in anger I
769,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Challenged his right for the love of this maiden
770,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
771,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,My challenge was answered in less than a heart-beat
772,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor
774,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Just for a moment I stood there in silence
775,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
776,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
777,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,I had but one chance and that was to run
779,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran
780,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Out where the horses were tied
781,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,I caught a good one
782,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,It looked like it could run
783,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Up on its back
784,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,And away I did ride
786,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Just as fast as I
787,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Could from the West Texas town of El Paso
788,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Out to the bad-lands of New Mexico
790,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
791,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Everything's gone in lifenothing is left
792,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
793,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,My love is stronger than my fear of death
795,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,I saddled up and away I did go
796,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Riding alone in the dark
797,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Maybe tomorrow
798,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,A bullet may find me
799,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Tonight nothing's worse than this
800,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Pain in my heart
802,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,And at last here I
803,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Am on the hill overlooking El Paso
804,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,I can see Rosa's cantina below
805,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,My love is strong and it pushes me onward
806,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Down off the hill to Felina I go
808,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
809,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Off to my left ride a dozen or more
810,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Shouting and shooting I can't let them catch me
811,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,I have to make it to Rosa's back door
813,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Something is dreadfully wrong for I feel
814,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,A deep burning pain in my side
815,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Though I am trying
816,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,To stay in the saddle
817,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,I'm getting weary
818,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Unable to ride
820,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,But my love for
821,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Felina is strong and I rise where I've fallen
822,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Though I am weary I can't stop to rest
823,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
824,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,I feel the bullet go deep in my chest
826,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,From out of nowhere Felina has found me
827,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
828,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
829,Country,Marty Robbins,El Pa,"One little kiss and Felina, good-bye"
