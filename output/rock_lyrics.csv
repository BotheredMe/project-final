0,Rock,Black Sabbath,Parano,Finished with my woman because she couldn't help me with my mind. 
1,Rock,Black Sabbath,Parano,People think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time. 
2,Rock,Black Sabbath,Parano,All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy. 
3,Rock,Black Sabbath,Parano,Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify... 
5,Rock,Black Sabbath,Parano,"Can you help me, occupy my brain? "
6,Rock,Black Sabbath,Parano,"Oh, yeah... "
8,Rock,Black Sabbath,Parano,I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find. 
9,Rock,Black Sabbath,Parano,"I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind... "
11,Rock,Black Sabbath,Parano,Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry. 
12,Rock,Black Sabbath,Parano,Happiness I cannot feel like love to me is so unreal... 
14,Rock,Black Sabbath,Parano,And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state. 
15,Rock,Black Sabbath,Parano,"I tell you to enjoy life, I wish I could but it's too late..."
