268,Rhythm and Blues,Chuck Berry,Maybelle,"Maybellene, why can't you be true?"
269,Rhythm and Blues,Chuck Berry,Maybelle,"Oh maybellene, why can't you be true?"
270,Rhythm and Blues,Chuck Berry,Maybelle,You've started back doing the things you used to do.
272,Rhythm and Blues,Chuck Berry,Maybelle,As i was motivatin' over the hill
273,Rhythm and Blues,Chuck Berry,Maybelle,I saw maybellene in a coup de ville.
274,Rhythm and Blues,Chuck Berry,Maybelle,"A cadillac a-rollin' on the open road,"
275,Rhythm and Blues,Chuck Berry,Maybelle,Nothin' will outrun my v8 ford.
276,Rhythm and Blues,Chuck Berry,Maybelle,"The cadillac doin' 'bout ninety-five,"
277,Rhythm and Blues,Chuck Berry,Maybelle,She's bumper to bumber rollin' side by side.
279,Rhythm and Blues,Chuck Berry,Maybelle,"Maybellene, why can't you be true?"
280,Rhythm and Blues,Chuck Berry,Maybelle,"Oh maybellene, why can't you be true?"
281,Rhythm and Blues,Chuck Berry,Maybelle,You've started back doing the things you used to do.
283,Rhythm and Blues,Chuck Berry,Maybelle,"Pink in the mirror on top of the hill,"
284,Rhythm and Blues,Chuck Berry,Maybelle,It's just like swallowin' up a medicine pill.
285,Rhythm and Blues,Chuck Berry,Maybelle,First thing i saw that cadillac grille
286,Rhythm and Blues,Chuck Berry,Maybelle,Doin' a hundred and ten gallopin' over that hill.
287,Rhythm and Blues,Chuck Berry,Maybelle,"Offhill curve, a downhill strecth,"
288,Rhythm and Blues,Chuck Berry,Maybelle,Me and that cadillac neck by neck.
290,Rhythm and Blues,Chuck Berry,Maybelle,"Maybellene, why can't you be true?"
291,Rhythm and Blues,Chuck Berry,Maybelle,"Oh maybellene, why can't you be true?"
292,Rhythm and Blues,Chuck Berry,Maybelle,You've started back doing the things you used to do.
294,Rhythm and Blues,Chuck Berry,Maybelle,"The cadillac pulled up ahead of the ford,"
295,Rhythm and Blues,Chuck Berry,Maybelle,The ford got hot and wouldn't do no more.
296,Rhythm and Blues,Chuck Berry,Maybelle,"It then got clody and it started to rain,"
297,Rhythm and Blues,Chuck Berry,Maybelle,I tooted my horn for a passin' lead
298,Rhythm and Blues,Chuck Berry,Maybelle,"The rain water blowin' all under my hood,"
299,Rhythm and Blues,Chuck Berry,Maybelle,I knew that was doin' my motor good.
301,Rhythm and Blues,Chuck Berry,Maybelle,"Maybellene, why can't you be true?"
302,Rhythm and Blues,Chuck Berry,Maybelle,"Oh maybellene, why can't you be true?"

305,Rhythm and Blues,Chuck Berry,Maybelle,"The motor cooled down, the heat went down"
306,Rhythm and Blues,Chuck Berry,Maybelle,And that's when i heard that highway sound.
307,Rhythm and Blues,Chuck Berry,Maybelle,The cadillac a-sittin' like a ton of lead
308,Rhythm and Blues,Chuck Berry,Maybelle,A hundred and ten a half a mile ahead.
309,Rhythm and Blues,Chuck Berry,Maybelle,The cadillac lookin' like it's sittin' still
310,Rhythm and Blues,Chuck Berry,Maybelle,And i caught maybellene at the top of the hill.
312,Rhythm and Blues,Chuck Berry,Maybelle,"Maybellene, why can't you be true?"
313,Rhythm and Blues,Chuck Berry,Maybelle,"Oh maybellene, why can't you be true?"
314,Rhythm and Blues,Chuck Berry,Maybelle,You've started back doing the things you used to do.

4169,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,(Spoken:)
4170,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,I was born and raised down in Alabama
4171,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,On a farm way back up in the woods
4172,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,I was so ragged the folks used to call me Patches
4173,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,Papa used to tease me about it 'Course deep down inside
4174,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,He was hurt 'cause he'd done all he could
4176,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,My papa was a great old man
4177,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,I can see him with a shovel in his hand
4178,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,"See, education he never had"
4179,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,He did wonders when the times got bad
4180,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,The little money from the crops he raised
4181,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,Barely paid the bills we made
4182,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,Oh life had kicked him down to the ground
4183,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,When he tried to get up life would kick him back down
4184,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,One day papa called me to his dyin' bed
4185,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,Put his hands on my shoulders And in tears he said
4186,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,"He said ""Patches, I'm depending on you son,"
4187,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,"To pull the family through,"
4188,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,"My son, it's all left up to you"""
4190,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,(Spoken:)
4191,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,Two days later papa passed away
4192,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,And I became a man that day
4193,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,So I told mama I was gonna quit school
4194,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,But she said that was daddy's strictest rule
4196,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,So every morning 'fore I went to school
4197,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too
4198,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on
4199,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,I wanted to leave just run away from home
4200,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,But I would remember what my daddy said
4201,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,With tears in his eyes on his dyin' bed
4202,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,"He said, ""Patches, I'm depending on you son"
4203,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,"I tried to do my best,"
4204,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,"It's up to you to do the rest"""
4206,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,(Spoken:)
4207,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,Then one day a strong rain came
4208,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,And washed all the crops away
4209,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,And at the age of thirteen I thought I was carrying
4210,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,The weight of the whole world on my shoulders
4211,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,"And you know, mama knew what I was going through, 'cause"
4213,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,Everyday I had to work the fields
4214,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,'Cause that's the only way we got our meals
4215,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,"See, I was the oldest of the family"
4216,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,And everybody else depended on me
4217,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,Every night I heard my mama pray
4218,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,"""Lord, give him strength to make another day"""
4219,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,Though years have passed and all the kids are grown
4220,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,The angels took mama to a brand new home
4221,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,"Lord knows people, I shed a tear"
4222,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,My daddy's voice helped me through the years
4223,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,"Sayin, ""Patches, I'm depending on you son,"
4224,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,"To pull the family through,"
4225,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,"My son, it's all left up to you"""
4227,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,"Oh, I could still hear papa's voice sayin'"
4228,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,"""Patches, I'm depending on you son,"
4229,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,"I tried to do my best,"
4230,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,"It's up to you to do the rest""."
4232,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,I could still hear papa when he's sayin'
4233,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,"""Patches, I'm depending on you son,"
4234,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,"To pull the family through,"
4235,Rhythm and Blues,Clarence Carter,Patch,"My son, it's all left up to you"""
