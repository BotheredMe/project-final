like cheese oh so you say ""thats it i got to leave this place i dont care what these people think im just sittin here makin myself nauseous with this ugly food that stinks"" so you bust out the door while its still closed still sick from the food you ate and then you run to the store for quick relief from a bottle of kaopectate and then you call your friend two weeks later to see how he has been and he says ""i understand about the food baby bubbah but were still friends"" with a hip hop the hippie to the hippie the hip hipa hopa you dont stop the rockin to the bang bang boogie say up jump
