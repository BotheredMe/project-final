1631,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,But your picture on my wall
1632,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,It reminds me that it's not so bad
1633,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,It's not so bad
1635,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,"Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote"
1636,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,"I hope you have the chance, I ain't mad"
1637,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,"I just think it's fucked up, you don't answer fans"
1638,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,If you didn't want to talk to me
1639,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,Outside the concert you didn't have to
1640,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,But you could've signed an autograph for Matthew
1641,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,That's my little brother man
1643,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,He's only 6 years old
1644,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,We waited in the blistering cold for you
1645,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,"For 4 hours and you just said ""No"""
1646,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,That's pretty shitty man
1647,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,You're like his fuckin' idol
1648,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,He wants to be just like you man
1649,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,He likes you more than I do
1651,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,I ain't that mad though I just don't like bein' lied to
1652,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,Remember when we met in Denver
1653,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,"You said if I write to you, you would write back"
1654,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,See I'm just like you in a way
1655,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,I never knew my father neither
1656,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
1658,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
1659,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,So when I have a shitty day
1660,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,I drift away and put 'em on
1661,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,Cause I don't really got shit else
1662,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,So that shit helps when I'm depressed
1663,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,I even got a tattoo
1664,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,With your name across the chest
1666,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,Sometimes I even cut myself
1667,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,To see how much it bleeds?
1668,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,It's like Adrenaline
1669,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,The pain is such a sudden rush for me
1670,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,See everything you say is real
1671,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,And I respect you 'cause you tell it
1672,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,My girlfriend's jealous
1673,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,'Cause I talk about you 24/7
1675,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,But she don't know you like
1676,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,"I know you Slim, no one does"
1677,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,She don't know what it was like?
1678,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,For people like us growing up
1679,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,You've gotta call me man
1680,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
1681,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,"Sincerely yours, Stan"
1682,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,P.S. We should be together too
1684,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?
1685,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,Got out of bed at all
1686,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,The morning rain clouds up my window
1687,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,And I can't see at all
1688,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,And even if I could it'd all be gray
1689,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,But your picture on my wall
1690,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,It reminds me that it's not so bad
1691,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,It's not so bad
1693,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,"Dear Mister, I'm too good to call or write my fans"
1694,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
1695,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,It's been six months and still no word
1696,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,I don't deserve it?
1697,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,I know you got my last two letters
1698,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
1700,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,So this is my cassette I'm sending you
1701,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,I hope you hear it
1702,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,I'm in the car right now
1703,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,I'm doing 90 on the freeway
1704,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,"Hey Slim, I drink a fifth of vodka"
1705,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,Ya dare me to drive?
1707,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,You know this song by Phil Collins
1708,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,'From the air in the night'
1709,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,About that guy who could have saved
1710,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,That other guy from drowning?
1711,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,"But didn't, then Phil saw it all"
1712,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,Then at his show he found him
1714,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,That's kinda how this is
1715,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,You could have rescued me from drowning
1716,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,Now it's too late
1717,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,"I'm on a thousand downers, now I'm drowsy"
1719,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
1720,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,I hope you know
1721,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,I ripped all  your pictures off the wall
1722,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,"I loved you Slim, we could have been together"
1723,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,"Think about it, you ruined it now"
1725,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
1726,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,"And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep"
1727,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,And you scream about it
1728,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,I hope your conscious eats at you
1729,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,And you can't breathe without me
1731,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,"See Slim, ""Shut up bitch!"
1732,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,"I'm trying to talk"""
1733,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,"Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk"
1734,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,But I didn't slit her throat I just tied her up
1735,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,See I ain't like you
1736,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more
1737,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,And then she'll die too
1739,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,Well gotta go
1740,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,I'm almost at the bridge now
1741,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,Oh shit! I forgot!
1742,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,How am I supposed to send this shit out?
1744,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I?
1745,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,Got out of bed at all
1746,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,The morning rain clouds up my window
1747,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,And I can't see at all
1748,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,And even if I could it'd all be gray
1749,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,But your picture on my wall
1750,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,It reminds me that it's not so bad
1751,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,It's not so bad
1753,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,"Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner"
1754,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,But I've just been busy

1756,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,How far along is she?
1757,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,Look I'm really flattered
1758,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,You would call your daughter that
1759,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,And here's an autograph for your brother
1760,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,I wrote it on your starter cap
1762,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show
1763,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,I must have missed you
1764,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,Don't think I did that shit intentionally
1765,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,Just to diss you
1766,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,And what's this shit you said about

1775,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,And what's this shit about us
1776,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,Meant to be together?
1777,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,That type of shit'll make me not want us
1778,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,To meet each other
1780,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,I really think you and your girlfriend
1781,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,Need each other
1782,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,Or maybe you just need to treat her better
1783,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,I hope you get to read this letter
1784,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,I just hope it reaches you in time
1785,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,Before you hurt yourself
1786,Hip Hop/Rap,Eminem,St,I think that you'll be doin' just fine
