38,Hip Hop/Rap,Boogie Down Productions,My Philosophy,"so you're a philosopher yes yes yes yes i think very deeply i think very deeply i think very deeply i think i think i think very deeply in about four seconds the teacher will begin to speak i think very deeply let's begin what where why or when will all be explained like instructions to a game see i'm not insane in fact i'm kind of rational when i be asking you ""who is more dramatical"" this one or that one the white one or the black one pick the punk and i'll jump up to attack one krsone is just the guy to lead a crew right up to your face and dis you everyone saw me on the last album cover holding a pistol something far from a lover beside my brother s c o t t i just laughed 'cause no one can defeat me this is lecture number two my philosophy number one was poetry you know it's me this is my philosophy many artists got to learn i'm not flammable i don't burn so please stop burnin' and learn to earn respect 'cause that's just what kr collects see what do you expect when you rhyme like a soft punk you walk down the street and get jumped you got to have style and learn to be original and everybody's gonna wanna diss you like me we stood up for the south bronx and every sucka mc had a response you think we care i know that they are on the tip my posse from the bronx is thick and we're real live we walk correctly a lot of suckas would like to forget me but they can't cause like a champ i have got a record of knocking out the frauds in a second on the mic i believe that you should get loose i haven't come to tell you i got juice i just produce create innovate on a higher level i'll be back but for now just seckle incomprehensible in about four seconds the teacher will begin to speak i'll play the nine and you play the target you all know my name so i guess i'll just start it or should i say ""start this"" i am an artist of new concepts at their hardest 'cause yo i'm a teacher and scott is a scholar it ain't about money cause we all make dollars that's why i walk with my head up when i hear wack rhymes i get fed up rap is like a setup a lot of games a lot of suckas with colorful names i'm soandso i'm this i'm that but they all just wickwickwack i'm not white or red or black i'm brown from the boogie down productions of course our music be thumpin' others say their bad but they're buggin' let me tell you somethin' now about hip hop about dnice melodie and scott la rock i'll get a pen a pencil a marker mainly what i write is for the average new yorker some mc's be talkin' and talkin' tryin' to show how black people are walkin' but i don't walk this way to portray or reinforce stereotypes of today like all my brothas eat chicken and watermelon talk broken english and drug sellin' see i'm tellin' and teaching real facts the way some act in rap is kind of wack and it lacks creativity and intelligence but they don't care 'cause the company is sellin' it it's my philosophy on the industry don't bother dissin' me or even wish that we'd soften dilute or commercialize all our lyrics 'cause it's about time one of y'all hear it and hear it firsthand from the intelligent brown man a vegetarian no goat or ham or chicken or turkey or hamburger 'cause to me that's suicide selfmurder let us get back to what we call hip hop and what it meant to dj scott la rock you're a philosopher yes i think very deeply i think very deeply in about four seconds the teacher will begin to speak how many mc's must get dissed before somebody says ""don't fuck with kris"" this is just one style out of many like a piggy bank this is one penny my brother's name is kenny that's kenny parker my other brother icu is much darker boogie down productions is made up of teachers the lecture is conducted from the mic into the speaker who gets weaker the king or the teacher it's not about a salary it's all about reality teachers teach and do the world good kings just rule and most are never understood if you were to rule or govern a certain industry all inside this room right now would be in misery no one would get along nor sing a song 'cause everyone'd be singing for the king am i wrong so yo what's up it's me again scott la rock krs bdp again many people had the nerve to think we would end the trend we're criminal minded an album which is only ten funky funky funky funky funky hit records no more than four minutes and some seconds the competition checks and checks and keeps checkin' they take the album take it home and start sweatin' why well it's simple to them it's kind of vital to take krsone's title to them i'm like an idol some type of entity in everybody's rhyme they wanna mention me or rather mention us me or scott la rock but they can get bust get robbed get dropped i don't play around nor do i f around and you can tell by the bodies that are left around when some clown jumps up to get beat down broken down to his very last compound see how it sounds a little unrational a lot of mc's like to use the word dramatical fresh for '88 you suckas"
